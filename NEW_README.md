# MarkLogic Kubernetes Helm Chart

## Prerequisites

To install this chart, you need to install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) and [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

To set up a Kubernetes Cluster for Production Workload, we recomend using EKS platform on AWS. To bring up a kubernetees cluster on EKS, you can install [eksctl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html) tool. Please refer to [Using eksctl to Provision MarkLogic Kubernetes Cluster on EKS](README.md/) for detailed steps.


For non-production deployments, please visit [MiniKube Setup Guide](docs/Local_Development_Tutorial.md) to create kubernetes cluster locally.
